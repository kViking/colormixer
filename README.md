# üé® ColorMixer

It's what it says on the tin: takes two colors, and mixes them. Whether you're a designer seeking the perfect blend, a developer needing color calculations, or just someone who enjoys playing with colors, ColorMixer has got you covered. Simple, straightforward, and surprisingly satisfying.

## Features

- **Mix Colors Like a Pro:** Or like an amateur. We don‚Äôt judge.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux and Windows, because we believe in equal opportunity for all operating systems (except maybe Mac OS).
- **Lightning Fast:** Because you have better things to do than click on extra buttons.
- **Minimalist UI:** So clean, Marie Kondo would approve.
- **Screw Formatting:** Handles whatever
  - (rrr, ggg, bbb)
  - rrr, ggg, bbb
  - rrr ggg bbb
  - \#4edec1
  - 4edec1 (the same thing but no hash)

## How to Use

1. Open the app.
2. Mix some colors.
3. Marvel at your creation.
4. Repeat until you forget why you started.

## Installation

- **Windows:** Double-click `colormixer.exe` in `build/windows/` and let the magic happen.
- **Linux:** Run the `colormmixer` executable in `build/linux/` (yes, we know there‚Äôs an extra ‚Äúm‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs a feature, not a typo).

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Bonus points for code that actually works. I am a meat machine that poops and writes bad code.

## License

Screw licenses, this isn't Mozart. If you get something out of it, I'm happy for you.
