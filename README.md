## Installation

### Windows

#### Precompiled Installer
Download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/kviking/colormixer/releases). (Unsigned, but safe to install over old versions.)

#### Source Building Script
Prerequisites:

- [Git BASH](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)
- [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later
- Flet, either in a virtualenv python version or across your system with `pip install flet` [NOT recommended]

Once those are up and working, open Git BASH and navigate to the source folder. Then run our build script:

```bash
./wbuild.sh {your version number}
```

A file `ColorMixerInstaller-{your version number}.exe will be in the source folder after its completion.

#### Manually Build From Source

Install Python 3.12 or later, either install pip or run `py -m ensurepip`. You'll need to update your PATH to make python scripts callable (definitely a Google it step, many have come before me and explained it better). Once Python is up and running, it's pretty smooth sailing. Navigate to the folder with main.py in it and then run

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
flet build windows .
```

In `windows/build` there will be an exe that will happily run on your system. To install it as proper program, you'll need [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php). In our folder, there's a script `inno-colormixer.iss` that will build an installer for you using Inno. Once it's installed, simply run

```powershell
ISCC.exe /DVersion={your_version_number} inno-colormixer.iss
```

and it should compile an installer for you. Takes about a minute.

---

### Linux

Build from source with Python 3.12+ and run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
flet build linux .
```

Also there is a bash script `wbuild` for windows builds, but could be repurposed for linux use with minor edits.

---

### Android

- Use the APK in `build/apk/` (experimental).

## Customization & Hacking

- All UI components are modularized in the `components/` folder for easy hacking.
- Core color logic, state, and hotkey handling are in the `core/` folder.
- Swatches and palettes are now defined in Python config (`core/config.py`).
- The user palette (custom color column) logic is now modularized in `components/user_palette.py` (extracted from `swatches.py`).
- The palette column only appears when the user palette is non-empty, and the input row's left padding dynamically adjusts for a consistent layout.
- Build scripts and installer logic are in `wbuild.sh` and `inno-colormixer.iss`.
- See the codebase and comments for developer onboarding tips.

## Build & Installer Scripts

- The `wbuild.sh` script builds, versions, and packages the app for Windows, with emoji-tagged CLI notifications.
- Use `./wbuild.sh --help` for all options, including direct notification testing.
- The installer is built with Inno Setup (`inno-colormixer.iss`).

## Testing

- Run all tests with `pytest tests/`.
- Tests use dummy classes to avoid Flet type errors and cover all major components and logic.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! See the code, tests, and hacking guide for details. Bonus points for code that actually works and is tested.

## License

No formal license. If you get something out of it, I'm happy for you.
