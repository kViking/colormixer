# ðŸŽ¨ ColorMixer

It's what it says on the tin: takes two colors, and mixes them. Whether you're a designer seeking the perfect blend, a developer needing color calculations, or just someone who enjoys playing with colors, ColorMixer has got you covered. Simple, straightforward, and surprisingly satisfying.

## Features

- **Mix Colors Like a Pro:** Or like an amateur. We donâ€™t judge.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux, Android, and Windows, because we believe in equal opportunity for all operating systems (except maybe Mac OS).
- **Lightning Fast:** Because you have better things to do than click on extra buttons.
- **Minimalist UI:** So clean, Marie Kondo would approve.
- **Screw Formatting:** Handles whatever
  - (rrr, ggg, bbb)
  - rrr, ggg, bbb
  - rrr ggg bbb
  - \#4edec1
  - 4edec1 (the same thing but no hash)

## How to Use

1. Open the app.
2. Mix some colors.
3. Marvel at your creation.
4. Realize there are little numbers at the bottom sometimes.
5. Find inspiration.
6. Repeat until you forget why you started.

## Installation

### Windows

Grab the installer from the latest [release](https://github.com/kviking/colormixer/releases)! It will probably set off every antivirus alarm because it's unsigned, but on the bright side it should also be fine to install on top of any old versions.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Bonus points for code that actually works. I am a meat machine that poops and writes bad code.

## License

Screw licenses, this isn't Mozart. If you get something out of it, I'm happy for you.
